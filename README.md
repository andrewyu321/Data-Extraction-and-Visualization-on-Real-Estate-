# Data-Extraction-and-Visualization-on-Real-Estate-

In the past few decades, Toronto has become a renters nation where prices have skyrocketed. This has become a prevalant problem as young adults looking to start their lives aren't able to afford housing. By creating a program that scrapes information on real estate pages, it can help first time home buyers find which homes in a certain area can fit their budget for rent.

For the data extraction tools I used were Selenium and Beautiful Soup. First I would BeaitufulSoup to open and scrape the first page of real estate websites. Then I would use Selenium to automate and parse through the website pages until the program reached the end. 

The data visualization aspect was used with Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy which would visualize the average monthly rental price of every area in Toronto that fit the parameters that were given as the inputs in the beginning of the program.
